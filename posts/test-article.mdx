## The Challenge

Geelong Artisan Collective, a popular local marketplace featuring handmade goods from over 50 local artists, was struggling with their outdated e-commerce platform. Their existing solution was slow, difficult to manage, and resulted in high cart abandonment rates.

Key problems included:
- Page load times exceeding 5 seconds
- Confusing checkout process leading to 45% cart abandonment
- No mobile optimization (60% of their traffic was mobile)
- Manual inventory management across multiple vendors
- Limited product discovery features

## Our Solution

We designed and developed a custom Next.js e-commerce platform tailored specifically to their multi-vendor business model. The solution focused on three core areas:

### Performance & User Experience

Built with Next.js 13 and React, we implemented static site generation for product pages and server-side rendering for dynamic content, reducing page load times to under 1 second. The responsive design works seamlessly across all devices.

### Streamlined Checkout

We integrated Stripe for secure payments and redesigned the checkout flow to be a simple 3-step process. Added features like guest checkout, saved payment methods, and real-time shipping calculations.

### Vendor Management System

Developed a custom dashboard where vendors can manage their inventory, track sales, and upload new products independently. This automated process eliminated hours of manual work each week.

## The Results

Within 6 months of launch, the new platform delivered impressive results:

- **240% increase** in online sales revenue
- **65% reduction** in cart abandonment rate
- **92% faster** page load times (5s â†’ 0.4s)
- **4.8/5 star** customer satisfaction rating
- **15 hours/week** saved on manual inventory management

The mobile-optimized design resulted in mobile conversions increasing from 12% to 38% of total orders.
